# VITAS
VIsualization Tool for Aircraft Synthesis
--------------------------------------------

VITAS is aimed to create plots that support the analysis
of dual-Doppler radar synthesis derived from airborne platforms.

The code is being developed and therefore is changing constantly. 

The current version is limited to a python script. Hopefully, in 
the future the code will become an installable python module.

Help about how to use the script can be obtained by calling:

```code
$./plot_synth2.py -h
```
